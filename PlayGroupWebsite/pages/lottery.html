            <p>On October 25th 2015 we were awarded a  &pound;10,000 "Awards for all Scotland" National Lottery grant! A big THANK YOU to a former parent Adele Hill and our manager Siobhan for making it happen.</p>
            <p>The grant was awarded for a year and will enable us to buy some new equipment, employ an extra member of staff, encourage our children to experience outdoor play and generally enhance the children's overall experience of playgroup.</p>
            <p>Keep an eye on our <a href="#/blog">Blog</a> to see where the money is being spent!.</p>

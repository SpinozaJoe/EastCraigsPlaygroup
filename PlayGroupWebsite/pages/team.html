                        I started at East Craigs Playgroup as a helper in 2009. This is the first time I have had the opportunity to work professionally with children, although I have had experience through running a Mother and Toddler Group, babysitting and night classes to train as a registered childminder. I also have a son in his teens.

                        As a mature student I achieved my SQV in Early Years Care and Education at Level 3. I have worked at East Craigs Playgroup for 6 years and love working with children.

                        I started at East Craigs Playgroup as a helper in 2009. This is the first time I have had the opportunity to work professionally with children, although I have had experience through running a Mother and Toddler Group, babysitting and night classes to train as a registered childminder. I also have a son in his teens.

                        I qualified as a child practitioner in May 2011 after completing my SVQ3 in Children’s Care, Learning and Development. I have attended courses in First Aid, Child Protection, Pre-birth to Three Framework plus registered with SSSC (and PVG)
                        I joined East Craigs Playgroup in January 2012, although I previously worked in the private sector caring for children from 3 months to 3 years old. I love looking after and helping children learn, develop and have fun through play – taking them on to the next steps/stages of their lives)
                        I have two grown up sons and it only seems like yesterday that they too were in playgroup!
                        In my spare time I enjoy walking our dog Tilly, participating in a yoga class and meeting up with friends.

                        I am a playgroup assistant here at Eastcraigs playgroup. I have worked here for 10 years. In 2008 I did a Scot Vec level 3 in child care.
                        My previous work was in various hospitals and community settings in Edinburgh, working mainly with adults & children with learning difficulties.
                        I ran the Parent and toddlers group at Eastcraigs on a Tuesday.
                        My youngest children both attended  Eastcraigs Playgroup.
                        I am kept busy out of work hours being a taxi service for my children and dog walker for my eldest son.
                        I help run a Rainbow group here at the church centre.

                        I first became involved with the playgroup when my children went in 2003/ 2005. They loved it and I appreciated the safe happy environment that was my children’s first experiences away from home. I started volunteering with playgroup in 2010 and eventually became a paid member of staff. I currently have a zero hours contract stepping in as the fourth member of staff when numbers require it on a Monday, Thursday and Friday.
                        I have enjoyed the luxury of being an at home mum to my two daughters. I keep myself busy volunteering at East Craigs Nursery with story sack provision, the primary school library and help look after the children whilst PEEP (Parents Early Education Partnership) sessions are running at East Craigs Church Centre.
